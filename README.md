Pet Weather App

Pet Weather App is a node.js application which allows user to determine whether their pet needs to have an umbrella or not by looking at the current weather condition. 
They can add their pet's current location multiple time and use that information to determine weather forecast before planning any future trips with their pet.  







Pet Weather App Setup 

1.Assuming  that you have a free Heroku account, any code editor. Make sure Node.js, git and npm installed locally or globally.


install the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI) (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up)
Once installed, you can use the heroku command from your command shell.
Example: 
Heroku login

clone the sample application so that you have a local version of the code that you can then deploy to Heroku
Example: 

git clone https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started.git

cd node-js-getting-started



4.Copy/paste 4 file from this repository into your local project which you just cloned in the above step.
    Example: 
    Package.json, Package-lock, index.js, views folder

5.Deploy the App locally
    Run the following command:

Npm install
Npm install cool-ascii-faces
Heroku create
Git add .
Git commit -m “init commit”
Git push Heroku master
Heroku ps:scale web=1
Heroku local

If still find difficulty in setup, I have also included word document (setup.docx) for better understanding.









FYI


# node-js-getting-started

A barebones Node.js app using [Express 4](http://expressjs.com/).

This application supports the [Getting Started with Node on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs) article - check it out.

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and the [Heroku CLI](https://cli.heroku.com/) installed.

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:heroku/node-js-getting-started.git # or clone your own fork
$ cd node-js-getting-started
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

## Deploying to Heroku

```
$ heroku create
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku open
```
